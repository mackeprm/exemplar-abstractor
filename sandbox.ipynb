By tracking and predicting your movements, the technology could be paired with other devices and could sense when to begin certain process. For example, it could detect your typical movement patterns in the morning and know when to turn on your shower for you so the water is warm, know when to begin brewing your coffee, and when to remote start your car.

If there is a way to tell when someone is moving a certain way, maybe we can prevent an attack.  d: 0.991\n",
