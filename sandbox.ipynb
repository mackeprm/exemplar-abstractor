For example, in using the way that this software perceives and analyzes movements, we can teach the software to tell us if the human is about to attack someone. There are certain ways a human body moves if they are going to hurt someone physically, by the way they move. If there is a way to tell when someone is moving a certain way, maybe we can prevent an attack.  d: 0.991\n",
